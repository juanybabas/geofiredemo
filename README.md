Project created for the space apps challenge

This code uses satellite imagery to assess the severity of a fire in a region. 

It does the following:

    1: Loads Sentinel-2 satellite imagery for a specific time period and geographic area.

    2: Filters clouds and cirrus clouds in the imagery.

    3: Calculates a fire severity index.

    4: Classifies the burned area into different severity levels.

    5: Displays the results on a map along with a legend explaining the severity classes.

    The video presentation of the application will demonstrate how users can use this tool to understand and assess fire severity in a specific region.
